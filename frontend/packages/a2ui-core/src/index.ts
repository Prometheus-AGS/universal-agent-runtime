/**
 * `@prometheus-ags/a2ui-core` — vendored, version-pinned re-export of
 * Google's `@a2ui/web_core` (A2UI Core Library, https://a2ui.org/).
 *
 * This package is NOT a fork or source copy: it is a thin, exact-pinned
 * dependency wrapper. UAR code should import from
 * `@prometheus-ags/a2ui-core` (this package) rather than reaching into
 * `@a2ui/web_core` directly, so that:
 *   - the upstream version is pinned and bumped deliberately (see
 *     UPSTREAM.md), and
 *   - a single internal import surface exists if/when UAR needs to patch
 *     or diverge from upstream behavior in a future change.
 *
 * Default export surface is v0_8 (upstream's own default), matching
 * `@a2ui/web_core`'s package.json `"main"`/`"exports"["."]`. Import
 * `@prometheus-ags/a2ui-core/v0_9` for the v0.9 surface.
 *
 * Upstream copyright and license (Apache-2.0, Google LLC) are preserved
 * verbatim in ./LICENSE and in every upstream source file this package
 * re-exports (unmodified, resolved via node_modules).
