## Delta

Revision 2 of the plan is written, and a fresh critic is reviewing it now. When it reports, I'll check its key claims against the source, append the review to the plan, and stop before implementation. Revision 1 and its review are kept in `plan-rev1.md`.

What changed from revision 1:
- **Surfaces belong to the thread.** UAR builds the record of published surfaces from durable run history merged with the live run events, not from the 512-event ring.
- **Every run restates the thread's live surfaces.** Each surface keeps a stable per-thread id, so a late-joining client or a resumed run still renders them.
- **Clicks keep working.** A button stays usable after its first click, and a retry with the same `actionId` replays instead of conflicting.
- **The action check is stricter.** It accepts only real Buttons whose context keys match their declaration, with size limits.
- **The action run's input stays intact.** The prior history is no longer cut short or overwritten, and the input stays valid JSON.
- **`profile` is stripped**, so PEM's strict schemas accept UAR's surfaces.
- **I19 now proves a real click and repeated use.** It presses the rendered button twice, retries, and has a fresh client join the thread.
- **The gate commands are exact,** and the regression list covers all five scenarios that use this route.

One wording change from your instruction: the plan uses the *live run events* rather than the realtime backbone. The backbone stores only a lossy summary of each surface, for example `createSurface` without its version, so it can't rebuild what a client needs.

## Root Cause

No explicit root-cause section was captured; preserve this as a session record, not an inferred diagnosis.

## Corrective Actions

Review and promote only reusable findings.
