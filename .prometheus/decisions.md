## 2026-08-09 — Migrated agent context from Base Rules v3 to the bootstrapped structure

**Decision.** Replaced the ~4,720-word `AGENTS.md` (and its duplicate `CLAUDE.md`)
with a managed region of ~1,396 words, plus path-scoped rules, deterministic hooks,
and this learning directory. Applied with
`prometheus-context-bootstrap/scripts/migrate.sh --apply`, profile `mixed`.

**Mechanism.** Resident prose now carries invariants only. Tier discipline,
single-writer, the sycophancy gate, and the compaction re-anchor moved from prose
into `.claude/hooks/`, where they are enforced rather than advised. Per-stack
commands moved to `.claude/rules/`, loaded on file read.

**Stakes.** Two constitutions in resident context degrade adherence to both; that
was the state before, since `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` each carried all 45 v3 rule
IDs. `CLAUDE.md` is now a symlink, so nothing double-loads.

Profile is `mixed`, not `lean`, because this repo is worked by more than one model
family. See `.prometheus/model-fleet.md`. Do not switch to `lean` on the strength of
a benchmark — measure against a fixed task set first.

## 2026-08-09 — RESOLVED: the 2026-07 production-completion lock is retired; the gap it guarded is now tracked debt

**Resolution.** The `uar-final-production-hardening-2026-07` execution lock is
retired. It is **not** restored to resident context.

The lock instructs every session to ask "does this advance changes 20-24; if not,
do not do it." The active waypoint is `uar-uiux-full-migration-2026-08`, status
`running`, 47/72. A resident rule that refuses any action outside a different
phase directly contradicts the phase actually being worked, and would outrank the
waypoint it explicitly defers to. Retiring the lock removes that contradiction.
It does not resolve the substantive gap, which is recorded below.

Its phase-independent rules — never `cargo clean`, batch fixes, CI as asynchronous
evidence, zero warnings, Linux/macOS Stable vs Windows Experimental — are already
carried in `.claude/rules/rust.md` and are deliberately not duplicated into
`AGENTS.md`. Duplicating resident and path-scoped context is the overlap this
migration exists to remove.

**The gap, as tracked debt.** v1.0.0 shipped ahead of at least one of its own
certification gates.

| Evidence | Value |
|---|---|
| `v1.0.0` tagged and published | 2026-07-11, GitHub release "First stable release" |
| Tag is ancestor of `main` | yes; `main` is +367 commits |
| KBD ledger | 20/24 DONE, 4 PENDING, `implementation.status: IN_PROGRESS` |
| Ledger last updated | 2026-08-08 — current, not abandoned |
| `evidence` / `certification` / `publication` | all PENDING, `summary: null` |
| SBOM / supply-chain artifacts at repo root | **none present** |
| `fix-sidecar-loopback-auth` | 5/6 tasks; unchecked 2.2 is `certify-operational-resilience` work under another name |

The four PENDING changes are `certify-operational-resilience`,
`produce-supply-chain-artifacts`, `certify-release-candidate`, `release-1-0-0`.

**The unresolved question, stated precisely.** Is `release-1-0-0` PENDING because
the ledger was never closed after the release shipped, or because the tag was cut
ahead of its gates? These have opposite implications.

For `produce-supply-chain-artifacts` the question is settled: **no SBOM artifacts
exist on disk.** Had the work been done and merely left unrecorded, the artifacts
would be there. Absence of the artifact is positive evidence of absent work, not a
lagging ledger. For the other three, nothing in the repo distinguishes the two
readings.

**Stakes.** This estate's commercial position is evidence discipline — SLSA L2,
signed receipts, provable governance. A 1.0.0 release without supply-chain
artifacts is a gap in exactly the thing being sold.

**What reopens this.** When release or certification work resumes: close the four
ledger items or correct the ledger to match reality, and **do not cut a 1.0.1
until `produce-supply-chain-artifacts` has actually produced artifacts.**

The KBD ledger was not edited here. Correcting `progress.json` is the
orchestrator's record and a separate, deliberate act.
