## Detailed Architectural Analysis

### 1. Streaming Architecture & AG-UI Compatibility

**Score: 95/100 (Exceptional)**

#### Current Implementation
The application implements a **dual-protocol streaming system** that is remarkably sophisticated:

```rust
// From src/normalized.rs - Dual event emission
pub fn dual_sse_event(evt: &NormalizedEvent, request_id: &str) -> String {
    let normalized = sse_event(evt);
    let agui = agui_sse_event(evt, request_id);
    format!("{normalized}{agui}")
}
```

**Strengths:**
- **AG-UI Protocol Compatibility**: Full implementation of the emerging AG-UI streaming standard with `agui.*` event namespacing
- **Event Richness**: Comprehensive event types covering message deltas, tool calls, thinking streams, citations, memory updates, and error handling
- **Future-Proof Design**: Dual emission supports both current client needs and future AG-UI ecosystem integration
- **Type Safety**: Full Rust type system enforcement prevents streaming protocol errors

**Industry Context (2024-2025):**
Based on research, AG-UI is becoming the standard for agent-to-UI communication, with adoption across major platforms. This implementation is **ahead of the curve** and positions the application for seamless integration with emerging agent ecosystems.

#### Recommendations
1. **Add Event Compression**: Implement event batching for high-frequency updates
2. **Add Event Replay**: Support for event history and replay capabilities
3. **Add Event Filtering**: Client-side event filtering for performance optimization

### 2. HTMX 2.0 Integration & Web Components

**Score: 90/100 (Excellent)**

#### Current Implementation
The application demonstrates **best-in-class HTMX 2.0 usage** combined with Web Components:

```typescript
// From web/components/chat-stream/chat-stream.ts
export class ChatStream extends HTMLElement {
  private view: TranscriptView | null = null;
  private controller: StreamController | null = null;
  // ... SSE management with native EventSource
}
```

**Strengths:**
- **Native SSE Management**: Direct EventSource usage instead of relying solely on HTMX's SSE
- **Component Isolation**: Each Web Component has single responsibility
- **Progressive Enhancement**: HTMX handles navigation while components handle interactivity
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Lean client-side code with server-driven updates

**Industry Alignment:**
Research shows this "thin component" approach over HTMX is gaining traction as the optimal pattern for 2024-2025, offering:

```rust
// From src/mcp/registry.rs - Dynamic tool discovery
pub struct McpRegistry {
    services: Arc<HashMap<String, DynClientService>>,
    tool_index: Arc<HashMap<String, (String, String)>>,
    tools: Arc<Vec<(String, Tool)>>,
}
```

- Faster initial page loads
- Better SEO performance
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Maintained developer ergonomics

#### Recommendations
1. **Consider Leptos Streaming**: Leverage Leptos' out-of-order streaming capabilities
2. **Add Leptos Islands**: Use for specific interactive components
