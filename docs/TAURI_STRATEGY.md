## 1. Overview
This document outlines the strategy for productizing the `universal-agent-runtime` application for Tauri, specifically addressing Server-Sent Events (SSE) compatibility and MCP server packaging.

## 2. Server Architecture: Localhost vs Custom Protocol
The application currently uses `EventSource` for critical streaming capabilities. Tauri's custom protocol (`tauri://`) does not strictly support `EventSource` in all WebViews due to origin policies.

**Decision**: Adopt a **Localhost Server** strategy.
- The Rust backend will spawn a local HTTP server on a random (or configured) port.
- The Tauri WebView will be pointed to `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` rather than loading assets from the custom protocol.
- This ensures 100% compatibility with SSE, valid origins for CORS, and standard browser behavior for all web APIs.

### Implementation Details
- **Main Process**: Finds an available port, starts Axum server.
- **WebView**: Initialized with the localhost URL.
- **Security**: The server should bind to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) only.

### Operational Detail (Definitive)
1. **Port negotiation**
   - Use an ephemeral port by default (`0`), then read the bound port from the listener.
   - Allow an override via `TAURI_LOCALHOST_PORT` for debugging or test harnesses.
2. **Health handshake**
   - Expose `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints on the local server.
   - Only load the WebView after `/readyz` returns `200`.
3. **SSE reconnection**
   - Include `id:` fields on all SSE events.
   - Support `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect; replay buffered events per-run.
4. **Single-origin web assets**
   - All HTML/JS/CSS served from the local server to avoid mixed-origin issues.
   - `tauri://` is used only for native APIs, not as the primary web origin.

## 3. MCP Server Packaging
The current `mcp.json` relies on `npx` for some servers (e.g., `time-server`). This introduces a runtime dependency on Node.js/npm, which is brittle for a self-contained desktop app.

**Decision**: **Pre-packaged Binaries**.
- All default MCP servers must be shipped as binaries or embedded within the main binary path.
- `mcp.json` should refer to paths relative to the executable or a known resource directory.

### Packaging Pipeline
1. **Build Step**: Download/compile MCP servers (e.g. `mcp-time-server`) to a `bin/` or `resources/` directory.
2. **Tauri Config**: Include these binaries as sidecars or resources.
3. **Runtime**: The application resolves the path to these binaries and updates the MCP registry configuration dynamically (or via relative path expansion).
4. **Environment**: Set `MCP_CONFIG_PATH` (bundled `mcp.json`) and `MCP_SERVER_DIR` (packaged sidecars) for deterministic resolution.

### Sidecar Resolution Strategy
- Prefer `tauri::api::path::resource_dir()` and `tauri::api::path::app_data_dir()` for platform-safe paths.
- On startup, resolve any `mcp.json` entry with `cmd` to an absolute resource path:
  - Example: `mcp-time-server` → `{resource_dir}/mcp/mcp-time-server`
- Validate executability and surface clear errors in the UI (not just logs).

### Offline Guarantees
- No runtime `npm`/`npx` usage in production builds.
- MCP tool registry should fail fast if any required sidecar is missing.

## 4. Client Lifecycle
- The `ChatStream` component is lifecycle-aware.
- `disconnectedCallback` invokes `view.destroy()` to clean up scroll listeners.
- This prevents memory leaks in long-running desktop sessions where tabs/panes might be closed and reopened.

## 5. Tauri-Specific Testing Hooks
- Add a `TAURI_E2E=1` mode that forces `localhost` mode even in dev.
- Provide a `healthz` probe in E2E to wait for readiness before tests.
- Validate SSE reconnection by restarting the local server while a stream is active.
