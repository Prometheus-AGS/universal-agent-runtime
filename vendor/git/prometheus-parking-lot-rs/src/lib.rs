//! # Prometheus Parking Lot
//!
//! A configurable, runtime-agnostic parking-lot scheduler for AI agent workloads.
//!
//! This library provides a dedicated scheduling layer that manages resource-constrained
//! workloads across different deployment environments. It implements a "parking lot" pattern
//! where tasks are intelligently queued when system capacity is exhausted, then automatically
//! woken when resources become available.
//!
//! ## Core Problem Solved
//!
//! AI workloads have fundamentally different resource constraints than typical web services:
//!
//! - **GPU VRAM Limits**: Running multiple LLM inference tasks can exceed available GPU memory
//! - **Expensive Task Loss**: AI tasks are computationally expensive - losing work due to restarts is costly
//! - **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Same logic needs to work in desktop apps, cloud, and web
//! - **Disconnected Clients**: Long-running tasks may complete after clients disconnect
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Resource-Aware Scheduling**: Tracks resource consumption in arbitrary units
//! - **Parking Lot Algorithm**: Tasks queue when capacity exhausted, wake when available
//! - **Worker Thread Pool**: Dedicated OS threads for CPU/GPU-bound work (native) or async tasks (WASM)
//! - **Persistent Queues**: Survive application restarts
//! - **Mailbox System**: Store results for later retrieval when clients disconnect
//! - **Multi-Environment**: Same code runs on desktop (Tauri), cloud, and web (WASM)
//!
//! ## WorkerPool - Thread Pool for CPU/GPU-Bound Work
//!
//! The `WorkerPool` manages dedicated worker threads (on native) or async tasks (on WASM)
//! for CPU/GPU-bound work like LLM inference. This ensures heavy computation doesn't
//! block your main async runtime.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::core::{WorkerPool, WorkerExecutor, TaskMetadata, PoolError};
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::config::WorkerPoolConfig;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Create a pool with 4 worker threads
//! let pool = WorkerPool::new(
//!     WorkerPoolConfig::new()
//!         .with_worker_count(4)
//!         .with_max_units(1000)
//!         .with_max_queue_depth(500),
//!     my_executor,  // Implements WorkerExecutor
//! )?;
//!
//! // Submit work (async API works on all platforms)
//! let key = pool.submit_async(job, meta).await?;
//! let result = pool.retrieve_async(&key, Duration::from_secs(120)).await?;
//!
//! // Blocking API available on native platforms only
//! #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
//! {
//!     let key = pool.submit(job, meta)?;
//!     let result = pool.retrieve(&key, Duration::from_secs(120))?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## ResourcePool - Async Scheduling
//!
//! For lighter workloads that don't require dedicated threads, use `ResourcePool`:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::core::{
//!     PoolLimits, ResourcePool, ScheduledTask, TaskExecutor, TaskMetadata,
//! };
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::infra::{queue::memory::InMemoryQueue, mailbox::memory::InMemoryMailbox};
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::util::serde::{Priority, ResourceCost, ResourceKind};
//! ```
//!
//! For complete examples, see:
//! - `tests/parking_lot_algorithm_test.rs` - Full integration tests
//! - `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
