//! Lifecycle hooks for pool events.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Pools emit [`LifecycleEvent`]s at key points in task processing. Any code
//! wanting to observe those events (metrics, logging, distributed tracing,
//! audit, alerting) implements the [`Hook`] trait and registers with a pool's
//! [`HookBus`].
//!
//! Hooks are **fire-and-observe**: the bus calls each registered hook and
//! discards the return value. Hooks must not modify pool state and should
//! complete quickly; heavy I/O should be offloaded to background tasks inside
//! the hook implementation.
//!
//! ## Zero-cost when empty
//!
//! `HookBus::emit` is a no-op when no hooks are registered. The check is a
//! single slice-empty test — no allocation, no virtual dispatch.
//!
//! ## AuditSink backward-compatibility
//!
//! The existing [`AuditSink`] trait is kept for compatibility. Use
//! [`AuditHookAdapter`] to register any `AuditSink` implementation as a
//! `Hook`.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use prometheus_parking_lot::core::hooks::{Hook, HookBus, LifecycleEvent};
//!
//! struct MetricsHook;
//! impl Hook for MetricsHook {
//!     fn on_event(&self, event: &LifecycleEvent) {
//!         match event {
//!             LifecycleEvent::Completed { task_id, .. } => {
//!                 metrics::increment_counter!("tasks_completed", "id" => task_id.to_string());
//!             }
//!             LifecycleEvent::Rejected { .. } | LifecycleEvent::Cancelled { .. } => {
//!                 metrics::increment_counter!("tasks_dropped");
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut bus = HookBus::new();
//! bus.register(std::sync::Arc::new(MetricsHook));
//! ```
